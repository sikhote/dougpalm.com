## How to update

All content is found within the `public/content` folder.

### Home / blog page

This page is controlled by `public/content/blog.md`. Any changes to this file will be published to the home page. This page is special, because, on desktop sized screens, the first headline and paragraph will be styled to fit inside the picture.

### All others pages

New pages can be added and edited by creating a folder within `public/content/pages` and creating a `index.md` file within that folder. The navigation will automatically update.

The contents of the `index.md` is placed at the top of the page. Any files that are also in the folder will be displayed in a list of files that can be downloaded.

### Editing `md` files

Markdown is a file format that allows certain formatting by using special characters, such as the `#` symbol to create a headline. Follow this [link](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for more information.
